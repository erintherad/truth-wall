## Truth Wall

![truth-wall](./truth-wall.gif)

A simple advice app which uses an advice read-only API. Users can click the add button to generate randomized advice which is appended to the truth wall. The advice will persist across different sessions or page reloads. Additionally, users can delete advice from the wall.

## Installation

To run this app:

1. `git clone git@github.com:erintherad/truth-wall.git`
2. `cd` into truth-wall directory
3. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` to start a simple server
4. Go to [browser](http://localhost:8000/) or localhost:8000

## Technology

This app was created with:

* jQuery
* [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for styling

## Future todos

With more time, I would have refactored this app into a React app or utilized a more OOP approach.
